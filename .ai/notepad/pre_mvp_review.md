# Pre-MVP Release Codebase Review

This document outlines key issues that should be addressed before publishing the MVP version of CAF GPT. The issues are organized by severity and component.

## Critical Issues

### Security

1. **Missing CSRF Protection in API Endpoints**: 
   - While `csrf_exempt` is used in `PaceNoteGeneratorView`, a more secure approach would be implementing proper CSRF tokens for authenticated views
   - Consider using Django Rest Framework for more secure API implementation

2. **Environment Variables Management**:
   - No clear validation of required environment variables
   - Missing fallback values for environment variables
   - Need to ensure secrets aren't exposed in logs or error messages

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Basic validation for empty inputs exists, but more comprehensive validation against SQL injection and XSS is needed
   - Sanitization of user inputs should be enhanced

### Configuration

1. **Incomplete Settings**:
   - `INSTALLED_APPS` includes 'pacenote_foo' but not 'policy_foo', despite URLs being configured for it
   - Debug toolbar configuration appears in URLs but not clearly in settings
   - No clear distinction between development and production settings

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Several imports reference services not visible in the codebase (e.g., `OpenRouterService`, `S3Service`, `PromptService`)
   - Requirements.txt or package dependencies management needs review

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Enhance Security**:
   - Implement proper CSRF protection
   - Add comprehensive input validation
   - Review permissions on views and APIs


### Medium-term Actions


1. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add client-side validation
   - Improve error messages and feedback
   - Implement accessibility features

2. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Configure GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
   - Implement Docker build and push workflow
