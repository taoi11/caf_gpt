"""Contains the main PolicyRouterView which acts as the central entry point for incoming chat requests.

"""
Workflow:
1. Receives incoming requests from the frontend with user messages or user and assistant message pairs if not a new conversation.
2. Extracts the 'policy_set' parameter from the request data.
  - Only 'doad' policy set is supported initially.
  - More policy sets can be added in the future.
3. Validates the 'policy_set' parameter against a predefined list of supported policy sets.
4. If validation fails, returns an appropriate error response.
5. For `policy_set` = 'doad', it calls the main DOAD orchestrator function/entry point located in `policy_foo/views/doad_foo/__init__.py`, passing the user query and conversation history.
6. Receives the final assistant response from the orchestrator.
7. Forwards the assistant response back to the frontend.
8. Handles rate limiting increment after successfully sending the response back to the user (details TBD, likely involves calling `policy_foo/views/rate_limits.py` or the core service directly).
