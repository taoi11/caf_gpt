"""
Contains the implementation for reading and processing the content of specific DOAD
documents identified by the finder, preparing the information for analysis or
summarization by the LLM.
"""

"""
Workflow:
1. Receives a specific DOAD number (e.g., "1000-1") and the user query/conversation history from the 'finder' component trigger.
2. Calls the S3Service to retrieve the full text content of the specified DOAD.
  - Bucket: `policies`
  - Key: `doad/1001-1.md` (example)
3. Loads the system prompt template from `policy_foo/prompts/doad_foo/reader.md`.
4. Replaces the `{POLICY_CONTENT}` placeholder in the system prompt with the retrieved DOAD document (full) content.
  - Note: Assumes the LLM can handle potentially long context from full documents.
5. Constructs the messages payload for `core/services/open_router_service.py`, including:
  - The formatted system prompt.
  - The user and assistant message pairs.
6. Sends the request to the LLM service (e.g., OpenRouterService).
7. Receives a loosely formatted XML response string from the LLM.
8. Sends the resulting XML string to `main.py`.
