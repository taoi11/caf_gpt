  - Request handling and error management
  - Response formatting and logging
  - Temperature and token control
  - Configurable model selection

- **S3Service**: S3-compatible storage access
  - File listing and retrieval
  - Error handling with custom exceptions
  - Configurable endpoints and credentials

- **RateLimitService**: IP-based rate limiting
  - Request counting and threshold enforcement

  - Gets `gen_id` from `OpenRouterService` API return
  - Half second delay after return of `gen_id` from `OpenRouterService`
  - Stores the total accumulated cost in a database table (`cost_tracker`)
  - Table creation SQL:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE cost_tracker (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        total_usage DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0,
        updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    INSERT INTO cost_tracker (id, total_usage) VALUES (1, 0.0) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
    ```

### Views
- **Landing page**: Entry point with links to all applications
- **Health check**: System status endpoint
- **CSP report**: Content Security Policy violation reporting endpoint

### Context Processors
