## Current Sprint

### Core App
- [ ] Create API client base class

### PaceNoteFoo App
- [ ] Implement backend API for Pace Notes generation
- [ ] Set up RagRetriever service
- [ ] Connect to an LLM provider
- [ ] Implement server-side rate limiting
- [ ] Add data validation for user input
- [ ] Create response formatting for pace notes

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement basic CI/CD pipeline

## Backlog

### Core App
- [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting
- [ ] Implement rate limit helper functions
- [ ] Add basic security tests

### PaceNoteFoo App
- [ ] Integrate LLM client
- [ ] Implement data validation/sanitization
- [ ] Add RAG data sources
- [ ] Create response formatting

### PolicyFoo App
- [ ] Implement ChatInterfaceView
- [ ] Create DocumentSearchView
- [ ] Set up PolicyRetriever service
- [ ] Add basic chat template
- [ ] Implement CitationGenerator
- [ ] Add export capability
- [ ] Set up response validation
- [ ] Configure policy document sources

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure deployment settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Implement backup strategy
- [ ] Define resource requirements for containers

### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write security guidelines

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Write security guidelines
- [ ] Optimize database queries

## Decision Log
- Use NixOS for local development: Better development experience with declarative configuration
- Use Docker for production deployment: Consistent deployment environment across different servers
- Use Bootstrap for UI: Faster development and consistent styling
- Use modular settings structure: Better organization and environment-specific configuration
- Use Neon DB for PostgreSQL: Serverless database with easy connection
- Use Python slim Docker image: Good balance between size and functionality

## Open Questions

### Core
- [ ] Decide on analytics tracking for landing page
- [x] Determine rate limit configuration approach (simplified for now)

### PaceNoteFoo
- [ ] Identify specific RAG data sources
- [ ] Determine response formatting needs
- [ ] Define safety controls for generated content

### PolicyFoo
- [ ] Identify required policy documents
- [ ] Determine response format requirements
- [ ] Define audit requirements

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Which LLM provider should we use?
- [ ] Do we need user authentication?
- [ ] What are the rate limiting requirements?
- [ ] What are the security requirements?
