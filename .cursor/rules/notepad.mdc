- **To Record Decisions**: Document why certain approaches were chosen over others

## Notepad Structure
- Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate the content
- Organize content with clear headings and sections
- Include examples where appropriate
- Link to relevant documentation or resources

## Notepad Content Types
1. **Idea Documents**: Brainstorming and exploring different approaches
2. **Implementation Plans**: Step-by-step guides for implementing features
3. **Decision Records**: Documentation of why certain decisions were made
4. **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and their solutions
5. **Best Practices**: Project-specific guidelines and standards

## Updating Notepad Files
