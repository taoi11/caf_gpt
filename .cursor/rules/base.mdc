# Project Guidelines

## General Approach
- **Simplicity**: Keep everything minimal and straightforward
- **Learning Focus**: Prioritize understanding over complexity
- **Iterative Development**: Build features incrementally

## Django Best Practices
1. **Project Structure**
   - Use Django's default project structure
   - Keep apps focused on single responsibilities
   - Use `settings/` directory for different environments

2. **Models**
   - Use descriptive field names
   - Add `__str__` methods for better debugging
   - Use Django's built-in validators
   - Keep business logic in models

3. **Views**
   - Prefer class-based views for common patterns
   - Keep views simple and focused
   - Use Django's built-in generic views

4. **Templates**
   - Use template inheritance
   - Keep logic in views, not templates
   - Use Django's template tags and filters

5. **Security**
   - Always use Django's built-in security features
   - Never store sensitive information in code
   - Use environment variables for secrets

6. **Testing**
   - Write tests for critical functionality
   - Use Django's test framework
   - Test both happy and error paths

## Development Workflow
- Start with simple implementations
- Add complexity only when needed
- Document decisions and learnings
- Regularly review and refactor code

## Documentation
- File-level: Brief overview paragraph at top
- Functions: 1 line docstring for each function
